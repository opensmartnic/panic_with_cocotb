There are three implementations in the repository, actually: 
A wormhole router (whr_top), a canonical VC router (similar to what the Dally/Towles book describes; vcr_top) and 
a router with combined VC and switch allocation (rtr_top). 
You can either instantiate them directly, or pass the appropriate "router_type" parameter to router_wrap to select one of them.
 (Also, note that all three use lookahead routing instead of a dedicated routing stage.)
